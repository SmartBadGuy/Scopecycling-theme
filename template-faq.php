With field-testing on different terrains and lab tests for brake performance, the maximum rider weight for all Scope Cycling wheels has been defined on 95 kg.

                $faq[] = array("Why are Scope Cycling wheels build with exposed nipples?","Hiding the nipple on our rims makes no less drag than having the nipple exposed at all wind angles. This, as it turns out, is due to the unique U-shape section of our rim. As a result, the final 14mm of the spoke is shielded, allowing us to keep the nipples exposed for ease of wheel maintenance without increasing drag.");

The brake pads supplied with the Scope Cycling wheels are specially develop in combination with our carbon rims. The Scope Cycling brake pads will ensure maximum braking power and heat resistance under extreme conditions. Not using the recommended Scope Cycling brake pads will void the Scope Cycling warranty of the wheels.<br /><br />
In addition, itâ€™s recommended to keep the brake pads used for alloy rims separate from the ones used on carbon rims to avoid alloy splinters which scratch the carbon and possibly may damage the fibers.");
                $faq[] = array("How do I choose the correct tire width?","The tire width highly depends on user preference and conditions. In general, a 21mm has superior aerodynamics in combination with our rims. A 23mm width tire subsequently has a better ride quality and rim protection, but at a slight aero penalty.<br />
